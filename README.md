## üìö Repository Structure

### 1. **Linear Regression**
   Linear regression is the building block of many predictive models. This section covers:
   - The principles of linear regression
   - Step-by-step implementation
   - Visualizations to understand model behavior and performance

### 2. **Polynomial Ridge Regression**
   Extend linear regression to handle more complex relationships while adding regularization to prevent overfitting. Learn:
   - Polynomial feature transformations
   - Ridge regression for regularization
   - Balancing model complexity and bias-variance trade-offs

### 3. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
   Discover the power of instance-based learning with KNN. This section includes:
   - Explanation of the KNN algorithm and distance metrics
   - Practical use cases and limitations
   - Code examples for classification and regression with KNN

### 4. To Be Developed...
